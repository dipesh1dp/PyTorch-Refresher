    "| [`torchvision.datasets`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html) | Here you'll find many example computer vision datasets for a range of problems from image classification, object detection, image captioning, video classification and more. It also contains [a series of base classes for making custom datasets](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html#base-classes-for-custom-datasets). |\n",
    "| [`torchvision.models`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html) | This module contains well-performing and commonly used computer vision model architectures implemented in PyTorch, you can use these with your own problems. | \n",
    "| [`torchvision.transforms`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) | Often images need to be transformed (turned into numbers/processed/augmented) before being used with a model, common image transformations are found here. | \n",
    "| [`torch.utils.data.Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) | Base dataset class for PyTorch.  | \n",
